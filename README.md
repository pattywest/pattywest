Hi, I’m Patrick Westerlund, I am a Senior Computer Science major at Iowa State University with a passion for software development and cyber security. A hard worker who is adept at solving difficult problems and situations. I have always been fascinated with computers and what makes them tick, and how the software is created. I love finding patterns and looking at data and figuring out what it means, and how it will benefit the world!'

Please feel free to look at/fork any of my projects!
